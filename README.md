# Helperz (Work In Progress)

### // Project Description  
We were challenged to do an APP in 29 hours, inspired by a theme song from the cartoon Kim Possible. After our brainstorming session we decided to make an application where people can accept missions that help others in need, by doing tasks, errands, all kinds of things, just like Kim does when she's saving the world. Later on, we included a rating and point system so users can get credit for their completed missions and share their certification on other social media apps.

### // Development  
We started by creating a scrum board and organising our sprints and assigning one of us as Scrum Master. We were four and started working in pair programming on the backend, designing the Models and the ORM for the database. After that, we divided the team, two on the frontend and two on the backend. As the aim was to do a RESTful API, the frontend was now able to start designing and consuming what the backend was exposing. 

### // Production  
After development, we deployed both backend and frontend to Heroku.
IMPORTANT (to run our Helperz webapp first load the backend page just once)
